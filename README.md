# pysword

A simplified version of pytorch implementing autograd and back prop. Using this
to learn how to make ML applications.

## Goal
To design a simple but efficient version of pytorch

### Tensor representation inside of Cuda <n-dimensional matrix>
### CUDA Kernal for matrix multiplication 
### Helpful => Design Entire System to do multiple computations in a row
